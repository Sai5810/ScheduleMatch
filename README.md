# ScheduleMatch
Life during the COVID-19 pandemic led to many feeling the effects of social isolation. There was little motivation to get out of bed, let alone work, and for students, this made the transition back to in-person learning incredibly difficult. We realized that kids and adults alike have this feeling, and it goes beyond work hours and into everyday tasks such as exercising, cooking, and cleaning. To combat feeling of isolation and increase motive to complete daily duties, we leveraged technology to connect people with shared interest and schedules to communicate and work in a fun, simple way!
